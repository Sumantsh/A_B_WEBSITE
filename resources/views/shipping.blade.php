We are proud to offer you a guaranteed delivery – in the improbable event that your order doesn’t reach you, we will re-ship it or we will give you a refund, provided that you supplied correct delivery details when making an order. This will happen if your order still hasn’t reached you after 30 days since it’s been sent from our side.
