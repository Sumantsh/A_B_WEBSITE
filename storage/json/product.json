Sildenafil belongs to a group of medications called phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Commonly the medicine is used to treat erectile dysfunction (male impotence). Sildenafil Citrate affects the response to sexual stimulation. Using a chemical called nitric oxide enhances smooth muscle relaxation, increasing blood flow into your penis to achieve and maintain erection. Sildenafil Citrate can be used for pulmonary arterial hypertension treating.</p><h2>Directions</h2><p>The recommended dose is 50 mg. It should be taken 30-60 minutes before sexual activity. Based on the side effects of the medication, the dose may be increased to 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg. You shouldn&#8217;t take Viagra more than once a day. It&#8217;s not recommended to eat high fat food, grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p>Before starting the treatment with Sildenafil Citrate, tell your doctor or health care adviser about any allergy you have. Middle aged people can be more sensitive to side effects of the medicine. This drug may make you dizzy or cause vision problems. Limit alcoholic beverages.

Sildenafil does not protect against sexually transmitted infections such as HIV.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p>Viagra should not be used with other treatments that cause erection or nitrates, because they can cause your blood pressure to drop very low. This may cause dizziness, fainting, heart attack, or stroke. Women, children and people with sensitivity to any component of the drug can&#8217;t use it.</p><h2>Possible side effect</h2><p>The frequent side effects are stomach upset, headache, flushing, heartburn, nasal stuffiness, dizziness or diarrhea, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, prolonged (longer than 4 hours), or painful erection.

A high-fat meal may reduce the effectiveness of sildenafil. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for additional information.</p><h2>Missed dose</h2><p>Viagra is used when it&#8217;s needed, so it&#8217;s unlikely to miss a dose.</p><h2>Overdose</h2><p>If you think you have overdosed the medicine seek emergency medical help at once.
